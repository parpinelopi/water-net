**Water-net**

This project (CLI) is a representation of a water quality control flow which takes place throughout a water network.
The classes

- Control
- ControlOrder 
- ControlResult 
- Laboratory
- Location
- Sample 
  
have been created. The classes include their fields, constructors and getters/setters (which will be replaced by lombok annotations in the next phase). 
The classes are to be developed further, unit tests are to be added and will be subject to change if deemed needed for purposes of refactoring and
code readability.

An initial diagram with the classes is provided.
